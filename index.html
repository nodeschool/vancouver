                <p>{{site.name}} is part of the global <a href="http://nodeschool.io/">NodeSchool</a> effort to voluntarily teach Node.js to anyone! The source code for the workshops is completely open source and the effort is entirely community driven. And the best part is, it's all free!</p>

                <p>We usually have two or three groups working on different problems at different levels.</p>

                <p>Our total newbie group is great fun and only general computer-use skills are required to participate. You'll find it's really inclusive and friendly and there's no better way to learn than with other of a similar skill level.</p>

                <p>We're all volunteers and attendees are of every level of experience and from all walks of life.</p>

                <p>Even if this is your first experience programming the only thing you need to start is a laptop and a sense of adventure. Bring your loved ones, bring your friends. There's no barrier to learning to code.</p>

                <p>If you do sign up and find you can't attend then please cancel your ticket as space is limited.</p>

                <h3>Installing Node</h3>
                <p>When installing Node through the default install binaries, the install path (on a Mac or Unix machine) is within a directory that requires root permission. This can lead to having to run <code>sudo</code> when interacting with Node. Because of this, we recommend using <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">nvm</a> when installing Node, since it will install Node into your user's home directory (avoiding any permissions problems).</p>

                <h3>Node</h3>
                <p>Once Node is installed, familiarize yourself with the Node environment using the links below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Node API documentation: <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/">http://nodejs.org/api</a></li>
                    <li>npm (Node's package manager): <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">https://www.npmjs.org</a></li>
                    <li>Mozilla Developer Network (JavaScript documentation): <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US</a></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>NodeSchool</h3>
                <p>If this is your first time using NodeSchool, try some of the core workshops. Make sure to <a href="#events">attend a local event</a>!</p>
