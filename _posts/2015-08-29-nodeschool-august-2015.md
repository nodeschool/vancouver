### Nodebot-specific

[Nodebot Workshop](https://github.com/tableflip/nodebot-workshop)

![Nodebot workshop menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tableflip/nodebot-workshop/master/screenshot.png)

Learn the basics of the [johnny-five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) api, as a series of code challenges.

[johnny-five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five) is an api for working with Arduino and other rapid prototyping boards.

**You _don't_ need an Arduino for this workshop.**

The workshop will pose a challenge, and will test your code.

The low level code to talk to the Arduino is stubbed out.

**You _will_ be writing working, executable johnny-five code.**

Each of your solutions can be run directly as a `node` program.

Wire up an Arduino, connect the USB and you can see your solution run for real.
