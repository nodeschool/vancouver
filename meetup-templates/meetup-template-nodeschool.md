Part of the **2019 Spring** Is Here Series **üåª**

This description is split into two parts, logistical details (bare minimum stuff you need to know like locations) and a meetup description. 

I highly recommend reading the logistical details, else you'll have inconvenient issues like not showing up in the wrong place. After that, the optional meetup description is for info about the session you're joining.

Cool? Read on üôÇ

Logistical details

A note from **Clio** about how to get there:

**"Our offices are located at 300 - 4611 Canada Way, Burnaby, BC. (https://goo.gl/maps/zLYUqopikfN2) When you arrive, there will be someone to welcome you at the front of the building to let you in. Once in please come up to the third floor and select ‚ÄúNodeSchool‚Äù in our sign in system and it will print a badge for you. You will only need to fill in your name, and each person that comes into the space must sign in. There are free Clio parking stalls (11-15) just out front our building, as well as pay parking on Wayburne Drive. There are also Evo and Car2Go Car Share parking lots at BCIT, which leaves you with a quick 10-minute walk to our office."**

Meetup description

Are you a beginner at using Node.js and/or JavaScript? Are you wanting a refresher? Are you looking to level up your knowledge? 

We don't have set classes, and as such it is considered a self study program. The NodeSchool organization has a lot of workshops for you to learn from, and we help out along the way, but that doesn't mean you have to do the workshops, we are a diverse group of people learning and growing together.

Bring your laptops and, if you can, have Node.js installed before you arrive. It's time for another session of learning!

We have regular mentors to help everyone learn. But we can't ever have too many people who want to help others learn, right?! We promise that by the end of the session you'll know enough to help the person sitting next to you learn too üí™

RSVP "yes" and come learn and/or help others learn Node.js and/or JavaScript over a casual Saturday afternoon!
