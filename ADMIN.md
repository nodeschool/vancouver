# Adding an organizer

Adding a new person to the organizers team? That's great! Here's a list of some places that should be updated to include the new organizer.

- [email aliases](https://github.com/nodeschool/email/blob/master/nodeschool.io/aliases.json): This lets the new organizer receive emails sent to the official NodeSchoolYVR email. Listed organizers receive all emails sent to the email alias.
- [chapter metadata](https://github.com/nodeschool/nodeschool.github.io/blob/source/chapters/vancouver.json)
