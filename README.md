# NodeSchool Vancouver üá®üá¶

- On the web: https://nodeschool.io/vancouver/
- On Gitter: [nodeschool/organizers](https://gitter.im/nodeschool/organizers)

NodeSchool is a series of open source [workshoppers](http://nodeschool.io/) that
teach web software skills.

NodeSchool meetups like NodeSchoolYVR provide a space for people to do the
workshoppers on their own or with others. The workshopper tutorials are used as
the course curriculum, while mentors are here to help attendees work through
challenges. Learn more [here](http://nodeschool.io/vancouver/).

## Join our meetups üíª

RSVP to our scheduled events on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/nodeschool-vancouver).
Feel free to come 15 minutes early and help set up!
