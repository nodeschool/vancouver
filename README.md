_**We organise all of our events in the [Issues](nodeschool/vancouver/issues) section here on GitHub**_

NodeSchool is a series of open source workshops that teach web
software skills. Individuals are encouraged to do the
[workshoppers](http://nodeschool.io/) on their own or at one of the
NodeSchool events around the world. The workshopper tutorials are used
as the course curriculum, while mentors are here to help attendees
work through challenges.
