# Hosting NodeSchool YVR

Are you interested in hosting NodeSchool Vancouver? We have a minimum set of requirements, and things other people have provided.

## Minimum requirements

* Seating and table space for 20+ people
  * Can be split into a couple rooms because we tend to split into smaller groups
* Wifi for 20+ people
* Power

## Nice to have

* Mentors
  * It's typically helpful to have people from your company/organization interact with members of the community. Participants find the contact supportive and a chance to discuss all sorts of technical, cultural, and experiential questions!
* Power strips
  * Some of the organizers have various power strips that can be loaned out if you don't have anything available
* Job postings
  * A large proportion of NodeSchoolers are looking for work (or open to the idea of changing roles)! It can be helpful to have a person who can talk a little about your company's open roles attending the session üíÅüèΩ
* Swag
  * Helps your company get remembered
* Whiteboards
